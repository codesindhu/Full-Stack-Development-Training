-->API is used to establish communication b/w two applications
-->there are two types of API's 
	1)SOAP API(source object Access protocol)--- HTTP,XHR(AJAX)--it is outdated
	2)REST API(representational state transfer)--- JSON--json supports more than 21 programming languages

                                            JSON(JavaScript object Notation)
                                         ---------------------------------------
--> it is plain text file where data will be stored in the form of key and value pair where all the keys will be enclosed with double quotes.
-->How to create JSON :
	Step 1 : create a .json file
	Step 2 : to create json we cannot use undefined and function datatype
		 in json we will store the data in the form of array(object) i.e., [{}, {}, {}]
-->Methods of JSON
1)stringify() : it will convert object to json type.
2)parse() :  it will convert json to object format.


-->Fetching JSON or API in three ways
1) By using fetch() method
2) By using Ajax
3) By using Axios
